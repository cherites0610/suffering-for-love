## goal

學生時期時常碰到升學壓力、有了家庭後而有的金錢壓力、或是想更認識自己等。總總因素壓制著生活，急切需要一個地方重新呼吸調整，我們的微服務以簡潔且方便的介面提供您預約心理諮商。心情留言讓你記下自己的心情，並自由分享給平台上的人

 During school years, students often face academic pressure, and after starting a family, financial pressure can arise or from the desire to better understand oneself. These factors weigh heavily on life, making it difficult to breathe and adjust. Our project offers a simple and convenient interface to help you schedule psychological counseling appointments. The "mood notes" feature allows you to record your feelings and freely share them with others.
